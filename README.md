SECURE DATA HIDING IN IMAGES USING STEGANOGRAPHY

Project Overview
This project explores the use of steganography techniques to embed confidential data into images, ensuring secure communication and resistant to attacks. The goal is to achieve efficient, undetectable data hiding for secure communication and confidential data exchange.

Techniques Used
- Least Significant Bit (LSB) method
- Computer Vision â€“ OpenCV (cv2)
- Transform domain methods (e.g. DCT, DWT)

Project Objectives
- Embed confidential data into images using steganography
- Ensure imperceptibility and resistance to attacks
- Enhance security and capacity of data hiding
- Achieve efficient, undetectable data hiding for secure communication

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Pillow (PIL)
- VSCode
  
Usage
1. Run the encr.py script to embed data into an image
2. Run the decr.py script to extract the embedded data
